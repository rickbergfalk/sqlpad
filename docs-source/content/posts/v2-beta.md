## SQLPad 2.0.0-beta.3 is now available on npm!

Over the last couple months I've taken some time to update SQLPad.
These updates include code cleanup, user interface/experience updates, and some new features.
While the work isn't finished, it is ready for preview.
I'm anticipating a few more updates throughout the month, with a stable release published October.

If you try it out I'd love to get your feedback on it! Feel free to tweet, email, or submit a GitHub issue.

## Installation

The v2 beta is installed like any other SQLPad version. 

Because of some minor changes to the user data model, 
you may want to take a backup of your SQLPad instance before you begin. 

First stop your existing SQLPad instance.

Next, locate your SQLPad database directory. 
By default it is installed in $HOME/sqlpad/db, but you may have changed that with the --dir flag.
Copy the files in this directory and set them aside in case you ever want to revert back to an earlier version of SQLPad.

To update sqlpad, run `npm install sqlpad -g` from a command prompt. 
This will update your sqlpad installation to the latest SQLPad beta.

Once installed, run SQLPad just as you would under version 1.x.x. 

Need to revert back? You can install an older version of SQLPad by specifying a version.
For example, to go back to the latest 1.x version run `npm install sqlpad@1.17.3 -g`.
