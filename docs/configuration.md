# Configuration

!> 5.1.0 deprecates JSON/INI config files and adds new environment variables. See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sqlpad/sqlpad/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for mapping.

?> .env config file support added in 5.1.0

SQLPad may be configured via environment variables or an .env config file.

Config file path may be specified passing command line option `--config` or environment variable `SQLPAD_CONFIG`.
For example:

```sh
node server.js --config path/to/.env
# or
env SQLPAD_CONFIG=path/to/.env node server.js
```

A [config file example](https://github.com/sqlpad/sqlpad/blob/master/config-example.env) can be found in the GitHub repository.

## Application Configuration (General)

```bash
# IP address to bind to. By default SQLPad will listen from all available addresses (0.0.0.0).
SQLPAD_IP = "0.0.0.0"

# Port to listen on. Used for both HTTP and HTTPS.
# Defaults to 80 in code, 3000 in Docker Hub Image
SQLPAD_PORT = 3000

# Public URL used for various authentication setups. Protocol is expected.
# This value will be sent with webhook payloads as well.
# Example: https://mysqlpad.com
PUBLIC_URL = ""

# Path to mount SQLPad app following domain.
# Example:
# If SQLPAD_BASE_URL = "/sqlpad" and PUBLIC_URL = "https://mysqlpad.com",
# the queries page would be `https://mysqlpad.com/sqlpad/queries`
SQLPAD_BASE_URL = ""

# Passphrase to encrypt sensitive connection information (like user & password) when stored in backing database.
SQLPAD_PASSPHRASE = "At least the sensitive bits won't be plain text?"

# HTTP server timeout as number of seconds.
SQLPAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 300

# Minutes to keep a session active. Session will be extended by this amount each request.
SQLPAD_SESSION_MINUTES = 60

# Store to use for user session
# Valid values are `file` (default), `database`, `redis`, `memory`
# `file` uses files in the sessions directory under SQLPAD_DB_PATH
# `memory` may be used for single sqlpad instances, and works well for no-auth setups
# `redis` offers best performance and is most commonly used. SQLPAD_REDIS_URI must also be set.
# `database` will use whatever backend database is used (or SQLite if SQLPAD_DB_PATH is set)
SQLPAD_SESSION_STORE = "file"

# Similar to session storage, query result storage may also be configured.
# Valid values are `file` (default), `database`, `redis`, `memory`
# If set to `memory`, store is limited to 1000 entries with a max age of 1 hour
# Other storage mechanisms fall back to SQLPAD_QUERY_HISTORY_RETENTION_PERIOD_IN_DAYS
# If `redis` is used, SQLPAD_REDIS_URI must also be set.
SQLPAD_QUERY_RESULT_STORE = "file"

# Name used for cookie. If running multiple SQLPads on same domain, set to different values.
SQLPAD_COOKIE_NAME = "sqlpad.sid"

# Secret used to sign cookies
SQLPAD_COOKIE_SECRET = "secret-used-to-sign-cookies-please-set-and-make-strong"

# Acquire socket from systemd if available
SQLPAD_SYSTEMD_SOCKET = ""

# Allows pre-approval of email domains for variety of authentication mechanisms.
# Delimit multiple domains by empty space.
SQLPAD_ALLOWED_DOMAINS = ""

# Path to root of seed data directories. See Seed Data documentation.
SQLPAD_SEED_DATA_PATH = ""
```

## Application Behavior

```bash
# Enable word wrapping in SQL editor
SQLPAD_EDITOR_WORD_WRAP = "false"

# By default query results are limited to 50,000 records
SQLPAD_QUERY_RESULT_MAX_ROWS = 50000

# Enable csv, json and xlsx downloads
SQLPAD_ALLOW_CSV_DOWNLOAD = "true"

# Allows access on every connection to every user.
SQLPAD_ALLOW_CONNECTION_ACCESS_TO_EVERYONE = "true"

# Query history entries created before the retention period will be deleted automatically.
SQLPAD_QUERY_HISTORY_RETENTION_PERIOD_IN_DAYS = 30

# By default query history results are limited to 1,000 records.
SQLPAD_QUERY_HISTORY_RESULT_MAX_ROWS = 1000

# Default connection to select on SQLPad load if connection not previously selected.
# Once selected, connection selections are cached locally in the browser.
SQLPAD_DEFAULT_CONNECTION_ID = ""
```

## Redis

Redis may be used for session storage as of `5.3.0`, and query result storage as of `5.4.0`.

```bash
# URI for redis instance to use when SQLPAD_SESSION_STORE or SQLPAD_QUERY_RESULT_STORE are set to `redis`
# Format should be [redis[s]:]//[[user][:password@]][host][:port][/db-number][?db=db-number[&password=bar[&option=value]]]
# More info at http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis
SQLPAD_REDIS_URI = ""
```

## Backend Database Management

SQLPad may be configured to use SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, or SQL Server as a backing database.

To use SQLite, all that must be set is `SQLPAD_DB_PATH`, and a `sqlite` file will be created on application start.

To use a different backend database, set `SQLPAD_BACKEND_DB_URI` to the desired target database.

```bash
# Directory to store SQLPad embedded database content. This includes queries, users, query result cache files, etc.
SQLPAD_DB_PATH = ""

# You can specify an external database to be used instead of the local sqlite database,
# by specifying a [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/v5/) connection string.
# Supported databases are: mysql, mariadb, sqlite3, mssql.
# Some options can be provided in the connection string.
# Example: `mariadb://username:password@host:port/databasename?ssl=true`
SQLPAD_BACKEND_DB_URI = ""

# If enabled, runs SQLite in memory
# In this case, the database contents will be lost when the application stops.
# SQLPAD_DB_PATH is still required to be provided for cache and session support.
# SQLPAD_DB_PATH will be made optional in future release.
SQLPAD_DB_IN_MEMORY = "false"
```

## Database Migrations

By default, migrations are run on service start up. This behavior can be disabled, and migrations can instead be run on demand. This is particularly of use when running multiple instances of SQLPad.

When run on demand, the SQLPad process will exit after migrations complete.

This option is most likely useful as a cli flag, but it can be specified via environment variable as well.

Example:

```bash
node server.js --config path/to/file.ext --migrate
# or via environment variable
env SQLPAD_MIGRATE = "true" node server.js --config path/to/file.env
```

```bash
# If set to true, SQLPad process will exit after database migration is performed
SQLPAD_MIGRATE = "false"

# Enable/disable automigration on SQLPad process start. Disable by setting to `false`
SQLPAD_DB_AUTOMIGRATE = "true"
```

## Service Tokens

Secret to sign the generated Service Tokens.

To generate a service token, log into SQLPad as an `admin` user and click `Service Tokens`. A service token can be scoped to a certain role (admin or editor) and limited to a window of time.

The generated Bearer token may be used by passing it via the Authorization header:

```sh
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer the.generated.token" http://localhost:3010/sqlpad/api/users
```

For more information on APIs available see [API Overview](/api-overview).

```bash
# Secret to sign the generated Service Tokens
SQLPAD_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET = ""
```

## Slack Webhook

!> Deprecated. To be removed in v6. Use [webhooks](/webhooks) and implement preferred communication instead.

```bash
# Supply incoming Slack webhook URL to post query when saved.
SQLPAD_SLACK_WEBHOOK = ""
```

## Logging

Minimum level for logs. Should be one of `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace` or `silent`. App logs contain log messages taken by application (running queries, creating users, general errors, etc.) while web logs are used for logging web requests made and related information, like time taken to serve them.

```bash
SQLPAD_APP_LOG_LEVEL = 'info'
SQLPAD_WEB_LOG_LEVEL = 'info
```

## HTTPS

HTTPS may be configured to be used by SQLPad directly. However if performance becomes an issue, consider [using a reverse proxy](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/blob/master/sections/production/delegatetoproxy.md).

```bash
# Absolute path to where SSL certificate is stored
SQLPAD_HTTPS_CERT_PATH = ""
# Absolute path to where SSL certificate key is stored
SQLPAD_HTTPS_KEY_PATH = ""
# Passphrase for your SSL certification file
SQLPAD_HTTPS_CERT_PASSPHRASE = ""
```

## No Authentication

Authentication may be disabled altogether, resulting in a single "user" being automatically added and used for any visit to SQLPad.

```bash
# Set to `true` to disable authentication altogether.
SQLPAD_AUTH_DISABLED = "false"
# Specifies the role associated with users when SQLPAD_AUTH_DISABLED is set to true.
# Acceptable values: `admin`, `editor`.
SQLPAD_AUTH_DISABLED_DEFAULT_ROLE = "editor"
```

## Local Email & Password Authentication

Local authentication is enabled by default. The default admin email and password may be provided via configuration. This configuration can also be used to "reset" an admin's password if ever forgotten.

```bash
# Email address to give admin permissions to.
SQLPAD_ADMIN = ""

# Password to set for admin email address on application start. Requires SQLPAD_ADMIN setting to also be provided.
SQLPAD_ADMIN_PASSWORD = ""

# Set to `true` to disable built-in local email/password authentication.
# Useful when using other auths like OAuth or SAML.
SQLPAD_USERPASS_AUTH_DISABLED = "false"
```

## Authentication Proxy

```bash
# Enable auth proxy authentication support
SQLPAD_AUTH_PROXY_ENABLED = "false"

# Auto create a user record if it does not exist when new user is detected via auth proxy
SQLPAD_AUTH_PROXY_AUTO_SIGN_UP = "false"

# Default role to assign user created when `authProxyAutoSignUp` is turned on.
# By default this is an empty-string and not used, expecting a role to be provided via header-mapping.
SQLPAD_AUTH_PROXY_DEFAULT_ROLE = ""

# Space-delimited field:header mappings to use to derive user information from HTTP headers.
# A mapping to `email` is required at a minimum assuming `authProxyDefaultRole` is set.
# Otherwise `role`, `id`, `name` and `data.<customField>` fields may be set.
#
# When supplying both `id` and `email`, `id` will be used for user matching instead of `email`,
# updating SQLPad user `email` fields when they change (assuming `id` is not changing).
SQLPAD_AUTH_PROXY_HEADERS = ""
```

## Google Authentication

```bash
# Google Client ID used for OAuth setup. Authorized redirect URI for sqlpad is '[baseurl]/auth/google/callback'
SQLPAD_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = ""

# Google Client Secret used for OAuth setup. Authorized redirect URI for sqlpad is '[baseurl]/auth/google/callback'
SQLPAD_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = ""
```

## LDAP

```bash
# Set to "true" to enable LDAP authentication
SQLPAD_LDAP_AUTH_ENABLED = "false"

# LDAP server URL. Examples: `ldap://localhost:389`, `ldaps://ad.corporate.com:636`
SQLPAD_LDAP_URL = ""

# Base LDAP DN to search for users in
SQLPAD_LDAP_SEARCH_BASE = ""

# Username for LDAP lookup
SQLPAD_LDAP_BIND_DN = ""

# Password for LDAP user used for LDAP lookup
SQLPAD_LDAP_PASSWORD = ""

# LDAP search filter. e.g. `(uid={{username}})` in OpenLDAP or `(sAMAccountName={{username}})` in ActiveDirectory
SQLPAD_LDAP_SEARCH_FILTER = ""
```

## OpenID Connect

```bash
SQLPAD_OIDC_CLIENT_ID = ""
SQLPAD_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET = ""
SQLPAD_OIDC_ISSUER = ""
SQLPAD_OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_URL = ""
SQLPAD_OIDC_TOKEN_URL = ""
SQLPAD_OIDC_USER_INFO_URL = ""
# HTML code for the sign-in link used for starting SAML authentication.
SQLPAD_OIDC_LINK_HTML = "Sign in with OpenID"
```

## SAML

```bash
# SAML authentication context URL.
# A sensible value is: `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport`
SQLPAD_SAML_AUTH_CONTEXT = ""

# SAML callback URL.
# It will generally be constructed from the deployment's internet address and the fixed route.
# For example: `https://mysqlpad.com/login/callback`.

SQLPAD_SAML_CALLBACK_URL = ""
# SAML certificate in Base64

SQLPAD_SAML_CERT = ""

# Entry point url
SQLPAD_SAML_ENTRY_POINT = ""

SQLPAD_SAML_ISSUER = ""

# HTML code for the sign-in link used for starting SAML authentication.
SQLPAD_SAML_LINK_HTML = "Sign in with SSO"

# Auto create a user record if it does not exist when new user is detected via SAML.
SQLPAD_SAML_AUTO_SIGN_UP = "false"

# Default role to assign user created when SQLPAD_SAML_AUTO_SIGN_UP is turned on.
# Accepted values are `editor` and `admin`.
SQLPAD_SAML_DEFAULT_ROLE = "editor"
```
